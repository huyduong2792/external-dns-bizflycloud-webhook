# ExternalDNS - Bizfly Cloud Webhook

**⚠️ NOTE**: his Webhook was forked and modified from the IONOS Webhook to work with Bizfly Cloud:
https://github.com/ionos-cloud/external-dns-ionos-webhook

ExternalDNS is a Kubernetes add-on for automatically managing
Domain Name System (DNS) records for Kubernetes services by using different DNS providers.
By default, Kubernetes manages DNS records internally,
but ExternalDNS takes this functionality a step further by delegating the management of DNS records to an external DNS
provider such as Bizfly Cloud.  Therefore, the Bizfly Cloud webhook allows to manage your
Bizfly Cloud domains inside your kubernetes cluster with [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns).

To use ExternalDNS with Bizfly Cloud, you need a Bizfly Cloud API key with permissions to create and modify DNS records.

### Deployment in Kubernetes
secret.yml
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-dns-bizflycloud
stringData:
  credential_id: "xxx"
  credential_secret: "xxx"
```

The Bizfly Cloud API is a RESTful API based on HTTPS requests and JSON responses. If you are registered with Bizfly Cloud, you can create your credential_id, credential_secret from [here](https://manage.bizflycloud.vn/account/configuration/credential).

`$ kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`

Example nginx deployment using the external DNS:

    matchLabels:

metadata:
  name: nginx
  annotations:

  selector:
    app: nginx

```

`$ kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml`

### Local deployment
```bash
export BFC_APP_CREDENTIAL_ID=xxx
export BFC_APP_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=xxx
```

```bash

make run

# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8888/records -H 'Accept: application/external.dns.webhook+json;version=1'
# Example response:
